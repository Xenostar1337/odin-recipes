# odin-recipes
This will be my Odin recipes website
I will build a website from the ground up of a recipe book, consiting of 3 recipe links going to individual webpages with a list of ingredients needed and step by step instructions.  

I will be using most of the basic html fundamentals for this.
The code will be my own, but I plan to use chatgpt for the recipe and instruction filler material.
